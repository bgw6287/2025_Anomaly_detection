## **Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sounds for Machine Condition Monitoring (DCASE 2020 baseline)**

**Description**

Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) is the task to identify whether the sound emmited from a target machine is normal or anomalous. 
The main challenge of this task is to detect unknown anomalous sounds under the condition that only normal sound samples have been provided as training data. ðŸ’»
